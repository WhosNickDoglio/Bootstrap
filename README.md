An opinionated Gradle plugin for Android/JVM project setup **heavily** inspired by
the [Slack Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/slackhq/slack-gradle-plugin)
and [Square's Herding Elephants article](https://dev.to/autonomousapps/herding-elephants-wrangling-a-3500-module-gradle-project-4658)
.

## Why does this project exist? 

- To spend less time on side projects creating the same build logic module I create in every side project. 
- To learn more about Gradle and testing Gradle plugins.
